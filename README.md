# Portfolio
This will be the first iteration of my personal portfolio website which I intend to modify and improve gradually over time. The URL destination is still to be determined. Some considerations include: estengrove.net, echo-optique.com, echo-alchemist.com

PURPOSE: 

-Practice the 7-1 Architecture method for organizing and separating components of the site in the development stage. 
-Practice creating and implementing completely independent components that are highly customizable.
-Delve deeper and obtain a greater understanding of Version Control and integrating/merging Pull Requests. 


GOALS: 

-Publish to my live site as a frame of reference for my work and history.
-Grasp a better understanding of managing and maintaining a large source without losing focus on the target.
